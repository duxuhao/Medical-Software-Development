[FDA instruction](https://github.com/duxuhao/Medical-Software-Development/tree/master/Material/AI to FDA/UCM575541_508ed_1.pdf)

-- Where the data comes from?

-- Add noise to verify the accuracy

For the data to be usable for AI training and testing, there are a number of considerations. In particular, the data must be:

- "numerous/voluminous" and available in machine-readable form

- accessible to the software developers with appropriate permissions/release by the data owners

- accompanied by complete and well-structured metadata (including information about the method and instruments that were used in obtaining the data such as medical images)

- representative of the breadth and variety of patient types and disease conditions that the proposed AI system is intended for
